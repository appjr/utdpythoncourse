# Topic 19: Reading & Writing Text Files



## Learning Objectives

- Open and close files in Python

- Read content from text files

- Write content to text files

- Append data to existing files

- Use context managers for file handling



---
## Why Work with Files?



Files allow you to:

✅ **Store data permanently** (not just in memory)

✅ **Share data** between programs

✅ **Process large amounts of data**

✅ **Create logs and reports**

✅ **Save user preferences and settings**



---
## 19.2 Opening Files



Use the **open()** function to open a file:
# Open a file for reading

file = open("example.txt", "r")



# Do something with the file...



# Always close the file when done!

file.close()
### File Modes



| Mode | Description |

|------|-------------|

| **"r"** | Read (default) - file must exist |

| **"w"** | Write - creates new file or overwrites existing |

| **"a"** | Append - adds to end of existing file |

| **"x"** | Create - creates new file, fails if exists |

| **"r+"** | Read and write |



---
## 19.3 Reading Files
### Reading Entire File
# Read all content at once

file = open("example.txt", "r")

content = file.read()

print(content)

file.close()
### Reading Line by Line
# Read one line at a time

file = open("example.txt", "r")

for line in file:

    print(line.strip())  # strip() removes newline characters

file.close()
### Reading Lines into a List
# Read all lines into a list

file = open("example.txt", "r")

lines = file.readlines()

file.close()



print(lines)  # List of strings, each ending with \n
---



## Writing Files
### Writing Text
# Write to a file (overwrites existing content!)

file = open("output.txt", "w")

file.write("Hello, World!\n")

file.write("This is a new line.\n")

file.close()
# Write multiple lines at once

lines = ["First line\n", "Second line\n", "Third line\n"]

file = open("output.txt", "w")

file.writelines(lines)

file.close()
---



## 19.5 Appending to Files
# Add content to end of file (doesn't overwrite!)

file = open("log.txt", "a")

file.write("New log entry\n")

file.close()
---



## Context Managers (with statement)



The **with** statement automatically closes files:
# Better way - file closes automatically!

with open("example.txt", "r") as file:

    content = file.read()

    print(content)

# File is automatically closed here
### Why Use 'with'?



✅ **Automatic cleanup** - file always closes

✅ **Safer** - handles errors better

✅ **Cleaner code** - no need to call close()



**Always prefer using 'with' for file operations!**

## 19.7 Practical Examples
# Example 1: Create a simple text file

with open("shopping_list.txt", "w") as file:

    file.write("Apples\n")

    file.write("Bananas\n")

    file.write("Milk\n")

    file.write("Bread\n")



print("Shopping list created!")
# Example 2: Read and display file contents

with open("shopping_list.txt", "r") as file:

    print("Shopping List:")

    print("-" * 20)

    for item in file:

        print(f"- {item.strip()}")
# Example 3: Count lines in a file

with open("shopping_list.txt", "r") as file:

    lines = file.readlines()

    print(f"Number of items: {len(lines)}")
# Example 4: Create a log file

import datetime



with open("activity_log.txt", "a") as file:

    timestamp = datetime.datetime.now()

    file.write(f"[{timestamp}] User logged in\n")



print("Log entry added!")
# Example 5: Read and process file

# Create a file with numbers

with open("numbers.txt", "w") as file:

    file.write("10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n")



# Read and calculate sum

total = 0

with open("numbers.txt", "r") as file:

    for line in file:

        number = int(line.strip())

        total += number



print(f"Sum of numbers: {total}")
---



## File Paths



You can use relative or absolute paths:
# Relative path (relative to current directory)

with open("data.txt", "r") as file:

    content = file.read()
# Absolute path (full path to file)

with open("/Users/username/Documents/data.txt", "r") as file:

    content = file.read()
# Path with subdirectory

with open("data/input.txt", "r") as file:

    content = file.read()
---



## Handling File Errors



Use try-except to handle file errors:
try:

    with open("nonexistent.txt", "r") as file:

        content = file.read()

except FileNotFoundError:

    print("Error: File not found!")

except PermissionError:

    print("Error: Permission denied!")

except Exception as e:

    print(f"Error: {e}")
---



## Checking if File Exists
import os



# Check if file exists before opening

if os.path.exists("data.txt"):

    with open("data.txt", "r") as file:

        content = file.read()

        print(content)

else:

    print("File does not exist!")
---



## Common File Operations



### Copy File Content
# Read from one file and write to another

with open("source.txt", "r") as source:

    content = source.read()



with open("destination.txt", "w") as dest:

    dest.write(content)



print("File copied successfully!")
### Count Words in File
with open("document.txt", "r") as file:

    content = file.read()

    words = content.split()

    print(f"Word count: {len(words)}")
### Search for Text in File
search_term = "Python"



with open("document.txt", "r") as file:

    for line_num, line in enumerate(file, 1):

        if search_term in line:

            print(f"Found '{search_term}' on line {line_num}: {line.strip()}")
---



## Best Practices



✅ **Always use 'with'** for file operations



✅ **Close files** if not using 'with'



✅ **Handle errors** with try-except



✅ **Use appropriate mode** (r, w, a)



✅ **Be careful with 'w' mode** - it overwrites!



✅ **Strip whitespace** when reading lines



✅ **Check if file exists** before reading



---



## Key Takeaways



✅ **open()** opens files, must specify mode



✅ **read()** reads entire file



✅ **readlines()** reads into list



✅ **write()** writes to file (overwrites!)



✅ **append()** adds to end of file



✅ **with** statement auto-closes files



✅ Always handle **FileNotFoundError**
